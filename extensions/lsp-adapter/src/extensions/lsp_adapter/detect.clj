  "Language detection + server registry + workspace-root resolution for the
   lsp-adapter extension (plan §7, simplified per Rev 2).

   Detection answers three questions for a touched file — which languageId,
   which server(s) claim it, which workspace root — as pure data over the
   builtin registry reshaped by user config. Only the final spawn (runtime)
   touches processes.

   Simplifications vs the original plan: no rust `[workspace]` special case
   (rust-analyzer copes rooted at the nearest Cargo.toml), and files outside
   cwd attach at their own directory instead of walking to home."
