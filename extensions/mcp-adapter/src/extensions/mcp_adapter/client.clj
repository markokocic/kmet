  "MCP client transports + JSON-RPC for the mcp-adapter extension (§7 of
   the design contract — pi: server-manager.ts adapted to babashka: sync,
   no SDK; JSON-RPC is spoken directly).

   Transports:
     :stdio           — spawn (babashka.process), line-delimited JSON over
                         stdout/stdin, core.async response channel, bounded
                         stderr tail for diagnostics, process-tree kill on
                         close (kmet.libs.process).
     :streamable-http — per-request POST (kmet.libs.http, :as :stream);
                         initialize captures Mcp-Session-Id;
                         responses parsed by content type (application/json
                         or text/event-stream).
     :sse             — GET stream with a background reader (endpoint +
                         message events), POST to the endpoint URL,
                         id-matched waits, reconnect-on-drop re-runs
                         initialize (bounded retry).

   Public protocol: request! / notify! / close! / alive? (§7.1).
   request! throws ex-info on JSON-RPC error, timeout, or transport death
   (§7.7 message patterns). Notifications received mid-request are
   consumed/dropped — except notifications/progress, which are forwarded
   to the :on-notification callback when one is given (streaming
   tool-call progress); stale responses (non-matching :id) are dropped and
   the wait loop continues. Every request!/notify! touches :last-used so
   the idle reaper can disconnect unused servers."
