(ns kmet.extensions.deepseek-peak
  "/deepseek-peak — DeepSeek API peak/off-peak hours in your local time zone.

   Shows when DeepSeek's API bills at the full (peak) rate vs the discounted
   off-peak rate, converted to the machine's local time zone, plus whether
   it is currently peak or off-peak and how long until the next switch.
   Hours per DeepSeek's official pricing page (api-docs.deepseek.com):
   \"Peak hours (in UTC): 1:00–4:00 AM and 6:00–10:00 AM, Monday to Friday.
   All other hours are off-peak.\" Off-peak is half the peak rate, so the
   whole UTC weekend is off-peak.

   The weekday qualifier is a UTC boundary, not a local one: west of UTC
   the week's first peak block (01:00 UTC Monday) lands on Sunday evening
   local time.

   The window table lives in `peak-windows-utc`; update it there if
   DeepSeek ever changes its schedule.

   Display follows /session: the panel is appended to the chat history as
   an :info message via kmet.extension/ui-chat-info — part of the live
   transcript, no overlay and nothing to dismiss, never sent to the LLM,
   not persisted across restarts. It is laid out as narrow lines (see
   `max-line-len`): the chat word-wraps content without a hanging indent,
   so a wide line on a narrow terminal comes back as scattered words.
   Headless/print mode falls back to a one-line flash — as does a host
   whose running instance predates the bridge (/reload refreshes extension
   files, not host code).

   The local time zone is detected explicitly: on Termux/Android the JVM
   falls back to GMT (no /etc/localtime) while Android keeps the real zone
   in a system property — so TZ, getprop, /etc/timezone and the
   /etc/localtime symlink are consulted before the JVM default.

   Usage: symlink or copy this file into ~/.kmet/agent/extensions/ (global)
   or .kmet/extensions/ (project-local), then restart kmet or run /reload."
