# kmet

A minimal coding agent built in Clojure/Babashka, featuring a terminal user interface (TUI)
with differential rendering, LLM integration, and tool execution.

Inspired by [pi](https://pi.dev) — a terminal-based AI coding agent.

## The name

*kmet* (Cyrillic **кмет**) is an old Slavic word. It goes back to Proto-Slavic `*kъmetь`
and is present in the oldest Slavic texts — Old Church Slavonic *къметь*, "a man of note",
the Old Russian *къметь*, "warrior, retainer" — and it survives in Serbian, Bulgarian,
Macedonian, Slovene, Czech, Slovak, Polish and Ukrainian.

Across the family it holds two opposite senses at once. Serbian has both: the *kmet* is the
village elder, the respected first man of a community, the people's judge in Montenegro — and
the *kmet* is also the bondsman, the serf bound to the land he works. The other languages
tend to keep one half: Bulgarian and Macedonian кмет is *mayor*; the Upper Sorbian *kmjeć* is
the "first peasant" who leads his neighbors; Polish *kmieć* is the established landholder;
Czech *kmet* and Slovak *kmeť* are the old men whose counsel the village keeps; Slovene *kmet*
is simply *farmer*, his *kmetija* the farm; Ukrainian *кміть* the working peasant.

So a kmet is the man of the ground from either end: the one who answers for the community,
and the one who works it.

A coding agent lives in both halves of that word. It leads the work in front of it — reads
the tree, orders the steps, dispatches the tools: the headman of the session. And it is a
servant: a retainer with its hands in the dirt of an estate it will never own. Holding both
stations in one word is the right posture for a tool given real autonomy — authority enough
to act on your behalf, never enough to forget whose code it is. (The italic **К** opening
the footer's first line is this word's initial.)

## Overview

kmet provides an interactive terminal UI where you can chat with any of 39
cataloged LLM providers (opencode-go, deepseek, anthropic, google, openai,
openrouter, mistral, bedrock, ...) — the model registry, catalogs, auth and
wire APIs are a port of pi's provider subsystem (see `models.md`). The agent
has filesystem tools (read, write, edit, bash, grep, find, ls) plus skills,
extensions and prompt templates. Fully cross-platform: runs on Linux, macOS,
Windows, WSL, and Termux (Android).

### Features

- **TUI Framework** — differential rendering, component model, overlays, raw-mode input
  ([package docs](src/kmet/tui/tui.md))
- **Multi-line Editor** — word-wrap, undo/redo, kill-ring, history, paste markers
- **Chat History** — user/assistant/tool message display with scrolling
- **Agent Loop** — orchestrates LLM calls and tool execution with streaming
- **Config System** — `~/.kmet/agent/settings.edn` and `.kmet/settings.edn` overrides
- **Theme System** — customizable ANSI color themes from EDN files
- **Session Persistence** — EDNL files with branching support
- **Skills & Extensions** — markdown skills and Clojure extensions
- **Provider Subsystem** — 39 generated provider catalogs (pi-faithful
  `models.md` port), `--list-models`, model resolution/cycling, cost display,
  custom providers via `models.edn`, OAuth logins (Copilot, Codex, Anthropic,
  OpenRouter), and an image-model registry (`kmet.app.image-models`)
- **Cross-platform** — Linux, macOS, Windows, WSL, and Termux (Android)

### Package subcommands

Install, remove, list and configure **packages** — extensions, skills,
prompt templates and themes bundled in a local directory or file (pi's
`install`/`remove`/`list`/`config` with local sources; npm/git package
installs are not ported):

```sh
kmet install ./path/to/package [-l]   # add a local dir/file package to settings
kmet remove ./path/to/package [-l]    # remove it again (alias: kmet uninstall)
kmet list                             # show configured packages
kmet config [-l]                      # enable/disable package resources (TUI)
```

- A **file** source loads as a single extension; a **directory** loads as one
extension (contains `extension.edn`) or scans its conventional `extensions/`,
`skills/`, `prompts/`, `themes/` subdirectories (pi package rules).
- Sources are recorded in `:packages` in `~/.kmet/agent/settings.edn` (global)
or `.kmet/settings.edn` with `-l` (project), stored relative to the settings
file. Configured packages load at startup and on `/reload`, after the auto
resource dirs.
- `kmet config` opens a TUI listing every package resource with a checkbox;
space toggles, Tab switches global/project scope (project scope cycles
inherit/load/unload), typing filters, escape closes. The writes are per-type
`+path`/`-path` filter entries on the package (pi's object entries).
Single-extension packages (a file source or an `extension.edn` directory)
ignore those filters, so their rows are marked *always loaded* and cannot be
toggled.
```

## Configuration

Settings are loaded from:

1. `~/.kmet/agent/settings.edn` — user-wide settings
2. `.kmet/settings.edn` — project-local overrides
3. Environment variables: `KMET_PROVIDER`, `KMET_MODEL`

Example `~/.kmet/agent/settings.edn`:

```clojure
{:provider :opencode-go
 :model "deepseek-v4-flash"
 :theme "dark"
 :thinking :off
 :session-dir "~/.kmet/sessions"
 :http-idle-timeout-ms 300000   ; LLM stream idle + total deadline in ms; 0 disables
 :http-transport :platform      ; :platform (default) = babashka.http-client with curl fallback (SOCKS proxies, live streams on Jolt); :curl = everything through curl
 :system-prompt "You are a helpful assistant."   ; replaces the default system prompt
 :append-system-prompt "Follow the project conventions." ; appended after it}
```

`kmet` reads its provider catalog from `src/kmet/ai/model_data/*.edn`
(40 providers: opencode-go, deepseek, anthropic, google, groq, cerebras,
openrouter, nvidia, moonshotai, qwen-token-plan, minimax, fireworks,
vercel-ai-gateway, zai, together, baseten, kimi-coding, cloudflare, mistral,
google-vertex, amazon-bedrock, ...; generated from models.dev + live
catalogs — `bb generate-models`). A user-level cache can be refreshed
without touching the repo: `kmet --generate-models` runs the same generator
into `~/.kmet/agent/models-cache/` (one `<provider>.edn` per provider +
`manifest.edn`, same layout as the built-ins), and that cache replaces the
built-in catalogs whenever it is strictly newer — so an upgrade shipping
newer bundled data wins over a stale cache until the next refresh.
Reruns with no upstream changes rewrite nothing. The image-model catalog
lives in `src/kmet/ai/image_model_data/image-models.edn`
(`bb generate-image-models`).
Models, base URLs and defaults are registry data; custom providers, API keys
and model overrides go in `~/.kmet/agent/models.edn`. OpenAI-completions
wire compatibility (thinking format, max-tokens field, reasoning
round-trip) auto-detects from the provider id and base URL; explicit
`:compat` entries in models.edn override the detected defaults.

The system prompt (pi-compatible) is built from: the default (or `:system-prompt`)
base, the active tools with one-line snippets, guidelines, `:append-system-prompt`,
the project context (`AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` from `~/.kmet/agent` and the cwd's
ancestors), the `<available_skills>` block, and the current working directory.

Like pi, prompt files are discovered when the config keys are unset:

- `.kmet/SYSTEM.md` or `~/.kmet/agent/SYSTEM.md` — replaces the system prompt
- `.kmet/APPEND_SYSTEM.md` or `~/.kmet/agent/APPEND_SYSTEM.md` — appended to it

Config values win over files; a config value naming an existing file is read as
content. CLI flags `--system-prompt <txt>` and `--append-system-prompt <txt>`
(repeatable) override everything.

`:http-idle-timeout-ms` (default 300000, pi: `httpIdleTimeoutMs`) is the LLM
stream deadline: a stream that receives no bytes for this long errors retryably
(undici bodyTimeout semantics), and the same value bounds the total request
(SDK `timeoutMs`). `0` disables both.

`/reload` re-reads settings, reloads extensions/skills/prompts/themes, re-discovers
context files, and rebuilds the system prompt (pi: `session.reload`). It refuses
while a response is streaming.

Compaction (pi-compatible): proactive compaction triggers before a run when
the measured context usage (latest response's reported usage + a chars/4
estimate of newer entries) comes within `:compact-reserve-tokens` (default
16384) of the model's context window. An explicit `:compact-token-threshold`
(estimated tokens) can override it. Context-overflow errors compact once then
retry. The pre-cut conversation is summarized via the LLM (structured
Goal/Progress/Next-Steps checkpoint, updated on subsequent compactions) and
replaced with a summary entry; `:keep-recent-tokens` (default 20000) sets how
many recent tokens to keep. `/compact [instructions]` triggers it manually.

## Themes

Create EDN theme files in `~/.kmet/agent/themes/`. See `examples/themes/` for format.

## Skills & Extensions

- **Packages**: share any mix of extensions, skills, prompt templates and
  themes as a local directory or file. `kmet install ./package [-l]` records
  the source in the settings `:packages` list; a package directory loads as a
  single extension (contains `extension.edn`) or scans its conventional
  `extensions/`, `skills/`, `prompts/`, `themes/` subdirectories. Filter what a
  package loads with the object form — `{:source "../pkg" :extensions
  ["extensions/*.clj" "!extensions/legacy.clj"]}` (plain globs include,
  `!` excludes, `+path`/`-path` force include/exclude, `[]` disables a type)
  or use `kmet config`. A project entry with `:autoload false` is a delta over
  the global entry of the same package (pi's package model — same pattern
  semantics as pi's `packages.md`).
- **Skills**: Place `name/SKILL.md` directories (or flat `.md` files) with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`) in `~/.kmet/agent/skills/` or `.kmet/skills/` — listed in the system prompt as `<available_skills>`; `/skill:name` loads one on demand (Agent Skills standard, pi-compatible)
- **Prompt Templates**: Place `.md` files in `~/.kmet/agent/prompts/` or `.kmet/prompts/` — `/name args` expands to the template body with `$1`, `$@`, `${1:-default}`, `${@:N}` placeholders; unknown `/cmd` falls through to the agent (pi-compatible)
- **Extensions**: Place `.clj` files (or directories with `extension.edn`) in
  `~/.kmet/agent/extensions/` or `.kmet/extensions/`. An extension is a Clojure
  namespace defining `(defn init [api])` (and optionally `(defn shutdown [api])`),
  depending only on `kmet.extension`. A manifest dir declares `{:name :entry
  :files}` — its own source deps. Loaded at startup, reloadable via `/reload`, and
  unloadable at runtime; unload runs shutdown + deregisters everything.
  Shipped opt-in extensions live in [`extensions/`](extensions/)
  ([usage](extensions/README.md)); writing your own:
  [`extensions/extensions.md`](extensions/extensions.md)

## Development

```sh
bb run             # Interactive TUI
bb test            # Run fast test suites (excludes ^:slow tests)
bb test-ext        # Run only the slow (^:slow) test suites
bb lint            # clj-kondo over src/test
bb format          # cljfmt (fix) / bb format-check (verify)
bb generate-models     # Regenerate provider catalogs (network)
kmet --generate-models # Refresh the user-level catalog cache (network)
bb generate-image-models # Regenerate the image model catalog (network)
bb check-model-data      # Offline catalog validation
bb help            # Show task help
```

## Building

kmet ships as self-contained executables: an official babashka release binary
with the kmet uberjar appended (babashka detects the appended zip at startup
and runs `kmet.core/-main` — see babashka's "Self-contained executable" wiki
page). Cross-builds work from any host because packaging is download + concat
only.

```sh
bb uberjar              # Build target/kmet.jar (also runnable: bb target/kmet.jar)
bb build                # Executable for the current platform -> dist/
bb build --all          # Every published babashka platform
bb build macos-aarch64  # Explicit targets; --force re-downloads, --no-smoke skips the post-build run
```

Targets mirror babashka's release assets: `linux-aarch64-static`,
`linux-amd64`, `linux-amd64-static`, `macos-aarch64`, `macos-amd64`,
`windows-amd64`. Babashka binaries are cached in `target/build-cache/`
(sha256-verified on download); artifacts land in `dist/` as
`kmet-<version>-bb<bb-version>-<slug>` (plus `.exe` on Windows).
`bb build` always rebuilds a fresh `target/kmet.jar` first so artifacts
never bundle stale sources. Downloads use `curl` (preinstalled on Termux,
macOS, Linux and Windows 10+).

Versioning: the artifact version is the git tag pointing at HEAD (`v` prefix
stripped), falling back to `<YYYYMMDD>-<short-hash>` from the HEAD commit
date when no tag points at HEAD, then `dev` outside a repo.

**Termux/Android**: the glibc babashka binary must be exec'd through Termux's
glibc dynamic linker — which also disables babashka's own appended-jar auto-
detection. Building on a termux host therefore additionally emits a companion
`kmet-<version>-bb<bb-version>-<slug>.sh` launcher that unsets `LD_PRELOAD`, execs via
`$PREFIX/glibc/lib/ld-linux-*.so.1`, and passes `--jar <self>` explicitly.
It requires the termux glibc package (`pkg install glibc-repo && pkg install
glibc`).
