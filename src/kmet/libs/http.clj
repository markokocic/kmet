(ns kmet.libs.http
  "The single outbound HTTP boundary for kmet and its shipped extensions
   (pi fetch with proxy support). All internal HTTP must go through this
   namespace — `babashka.http-client` requires and raw `curl` invocations
   are forbidden in consumers (enforced by an architecture test).

   Transport-neutral request API close to babashka.http-client's:

     (http/request {:url ... :method :get :headers {...} :body ...
                    :as :string          ;; :string | :bytes | :stream
                    :timeout 30000       ;; ms (nil disables, default 120s on curl path)
                    :throw? true         ;; throw on HTTP >= 400
                    :follow-redirects :normal
                    :signal cancel-atom  ;; curl path only
                    :proxy :env})        ;; :env | :none | explicit proxy map

     (http/get url opts) (http/post url opts)
     (http/request-json url opts)
     (http/abort! response) (http/close! response)

   Responses are always {:status n :headers {...} :body ...} — :headers
   lowercased string keys (babashka's convention) — regardless of
   transport. Errors are structured ex-info:

     {:type :http-error      :status :headers :body}    ;; HTTP >= 400
     {:type :transport-error :cause ...}                ;; connect/DNS/timeout/...

   `transport-error-message` classifies raw JVM exceptions (the retry
   classifier's stable \"network error\" token), so callers never depend on
   transport-specific exception types.

   Proxy handling (curl semantics, ported from the retired kmet.libs.proxy):
   HTTPS_PROXY / HTTP_PROXY / ALL_PROXY / SOCKS_PROXY with upper- and
   lowercase env vars and NO_PROXY host/subdomain/port/CIDR/IPv4/IPv6
   matching. Plain http-scheme proxies route through java.net.http (the
   babashka engine); SOCKS and https-scheme (TLS-speaking) proxies route
   through curl with full status/headers parity. Proxy selection is
   transparent — callers never see the transport. `:proxy :none` forces a
   direct connection; the env seam is testable via a map (proxy-for-url)."
