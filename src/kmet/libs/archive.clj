  "Zip extraction shared by the build packager (kmet.build) and extensions
   (e.g. the tree-sitter CLI download).
   Host-evaluated with full Java interop and shared by reference, so
   extension SCI contexts — where instance methods on JDK inner classes
   such as ZipFile$ZipFileInflaterInputStream are not callable — get zip
   support through one audited zip-slip guard instead of reimplementing it.

   bb-only: extraction runs on java.util.zip, which the jolt host does not
   provide, and no jolt runtime code calls it (kmet.build is bb-only;
   extensions are disabled on jolt) — extract-zip! fails fast with ::bb-only
   under jolt. When extension jars light up on jolt they materialize to
   directories via unzip (jolt's own mvn-jar model) instead of this path."
