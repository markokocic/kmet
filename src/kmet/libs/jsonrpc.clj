(ns kmet.libs.jsonrpc
  "JSON-RPC 2.0 plumbing for stdio-speaking protocols (LSP, MCP), shared by
   extension adapters via the libs layer.

   Two framings:
     :content-length  LSP base protocol — `Content-Length: N\r\n\r\n` header
                      block followed by exactly N UTF-8 bytes. Byte counts are
                      computed on the encoded byte array, never on chars; reads
                      take exactly N bytes before decoding.
     :line-delimited  newline-separated JSON (MCP stdio style); non-JSON lines
                      (banners) are dropped.

   One connection = one child process (or injected streams, for tests) plus a
   daemon reader thread that classifies every incoming message:
     response     (:id matching a pending request) -> delivers its promise;
                  stale/unknown ids are dropped
     request      (:method + :id) -> answered from :on-request — its return
                  value becomes :result, nil becomes -32601 MethodNotFound,
                  a throwing handler -32603
     notification (:method, no :id) -> :on-notification, exceptions swallowed

   EOF/process death fails every pending request with ::transport-dead so
   callers can distinguish timeout from death. Writes are serialized under a
   lock; requests pipeline safely after registration. Known limitation:
   writes block (no async writer thread) — a server wedged with a full
   input pipe stalls writers indefinitely; bounded by close! closing the
   streams underneath.

   kmet.* requires (kmet.libs.test-self-contained)."
