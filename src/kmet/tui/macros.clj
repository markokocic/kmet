  "Macros for TUI components.

   track! — reactive render cache: rewrites @atom reads in the render body to
   tracked derefs, so any atom change invalidates the cache automatically and
   setters need no manual invalidate call. It must be a macro because deref
   rewriting happens at compile time; it expands to a plain runtime call
   (track-render), so SCI-based callers only need the function, not the macro.

   defsetter / defgetter — component state accessor boilerplate: generate the
   (defn name [comp value] (reset! (:field comp) value)) skeleton that every
   component setter/getter repeats.")
