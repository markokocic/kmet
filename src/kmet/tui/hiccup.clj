(ns kmet.tui.hiccup
  "Hiccup-style construction + reconciliation layer for the TUI DSL
   (tui.md §2).

   Trees are plain data: [:tag {props} children...] or [my-fn {props}]
   function heads. Compilation walks the tree through a CLOSED TAG TABLE —
   there is no registry; custom composition uses fn components (wrapped in
   ComponentFn, their bodies running inside reactions with auto-discovered
   deps) or raw components spliced into the tree (identity preserved,
   never disposed — they are owned elsewhere): defcomponent/defrecord
   instances AND reified or deftype'd IComponent objects (hand-rolled
   components from widgets or extension code) splice identically.

   Reconciliation (tui.md §2.3): ONE keyed diff drives everything — the
   ComponentFn wrapper's child list AND the fill of every host container
   (through per-tag children lenses). Matching is explicit :key first
   (from the props map or, reagent-style, from the element vector's own
   metadata — ^{:key k} [:text …]; props win when both are given),
   fallback match-kind (tag / fn value / record payload / string);
   unmatched previous children are disposed (children-first contract),
   matched ones are reused — identity survives reorders by key, so stateful
   subtrees (editors, fn components with with-let state) live across
   passes. Ownership rides the :dsl/meta stamp: everything the DSL
   constructs carries it; foreign records never do and are never disposed.

   Props: display leaves (text/markdown/spacer/string) are rebuilt when
   their props change — identity-free, their caches absorb rendering;
   equal props short-circuit to the same instance. Stateful tags declare
   an :apply path (see the tag table): a changed prop patches the live
   instance — state and focus survive — and only a prop the tag cannot
   express rebuilds it. Containers keep their instance across passes and
   reconcile their children in place; their structural props
   (padding/gap) are live through their own :apply (which must be TOTAL —
   a container never rebuilds, since a fresh construct starts with an
   empty child pool and would take the whole subtree's state with it).

   Validation is loud per the v1 error contract: unknown tags throw with a
   did-you-mean suggestion, children on a leaf tag throw, duplicate :keys
   throw, stack-entry maps outside a stack tag throw.

   Mounting goes through hiccup/root — the one public constructor from a
   tree to a mounted, disposable IComponent (a ComponentFn). render-lines
   gives the headless surface: pure data in, lines out, no terminal."

;;   :lens       — present iff the tag takes children; get/put fns over the

;;   :entries?   — children of this tag may be stack entry maps
;;   :apply      — optional prop→state patch path for stateful tags:
;;                 (fn [comp prev-props props]) called on a matched leaf
;;                 whose props CHANGED; truthy = patch applied, the

;;                 falsy = the tag cannot express these props on the live
;;                 instance and the leaf is retired and rebuilt as usual.
;;                 Check structural props FIRST and return falsy before
;;                 mutating; compare them in their CONSTRUCTED form (a nil
;;                 prop and its default are the same component) so a
;;                 spelling change does not churn a rebuild. Tags without
;;                 :apply always rebuild on change (display leaves are
;;                 identity-free by design). CONTAINER tags (:box,
;;                 :v-stack, :h-stack, :scroll-view) are the exception:
;;                 a container NEVER rebuilds (its children would lose

;;                 express every prop, or (with no :apply on the tag)
;;                 leave the structural props as constructed.
;;
;;                 Inside an :apply, a STATE-CARRYING prop is written
;;                 through only when it differs from PREV-PROPS, and then
;;                 coerced the way construction coerces it (nil ⇒ the
;;                 default). An unchanged prop never overwrites live state
;;                 — that is what lets typing, selection and expansion
;;                 survive an unrelated prop change — while a changed prop
;;                 is an instruction and wins.
