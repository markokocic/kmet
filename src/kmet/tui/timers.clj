(ns kmet.tui.timers
  "Loop-owned timer registry (tui.md §6.1): the one place time-driven
   UI work is scheduled, instead of every component parking its own
   `future` + `Thread/sleep` loop and re-inventing the zombie defense.

   The frame loop (~16ms) calls `pump!` once a tick and fires whatever is
   due, so a timer thunk runs on the LOOP THREAD — the same thread that
   renders — and may touch widgets and component state directly. A thunk
   that wants a repaint either mutates tracked state (the reactive chain
   schedules the frame) or calls `kmet.tui.macros/schedule-frame!`.

   Repeating timers reschedule from *now*, not from the missed due time:
   a UI spinner that fell behind must not fire a burst to catch up. A
   throwing thunk is logged and swallowed (the loop must survive it), and
   a repeating timer keeps its next tick — the same policy as
   `macros/schedule-frame!`.

   The registry is process-global (like the frame hook) because components
   reach it without a reference to the TUI instance; `tui.core` pumps it
   each tick and calls `cancel-all!` on stop, so no timer outlives the
   session that created it. Headless tests drive `pump!` by hand.")
