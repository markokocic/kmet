  "Terminal backend abstraction: the ITerminal protocol plus the portable
   terminal knowledge every backend shares.

   The TUI core reaches the OS only through ITerminal. A backend supplies
   the platform primitives — raw mode, writing, bounded reads, live size,
   the progress keepalive; everything else (cursor/clear/title sequences,
   write log, Kitty negotiation, terminal queries, drain-on-exit) is
   derived here or in kmet.libs.terminal. Backends are resolved lazily by
   create-terminal, so neither host touches the other's platform deps:

   - kmet.tui.terminal-jline  — Babashka/JVM: JLine 4.3.1 (bundled).
   - kmet.tui.terminal-native — Jolt: termios (Unix) / kernel32 (Windows)
     raw mode, byte reads and live size over jolt.ffi.

   A backend record owns its private state (reader/writer, raw-mode
   snapshot, progress interval atom); nothing outside the backend reads
   those fields."
