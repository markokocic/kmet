(ns kmet.app.ui.custom-dialog-adapter
  "Adapter mounting foreign dialog implementations (pi: ctx.ui.custom's
   Component / duck-typed object) into kmet's TUI surfaces.

   Extension factories may return a plain {:render :handle-input
   :invalidate :dispose} map or a hiccup element tree; ui-custom wraps
   either in a CustomDialogAdapter so the dock/widget strips hold a
   defcomponent RECORD. Records splice into hiccup trees by record? —
   no protocol-identity checks involved. That matters because bb's
   satisfies? can return false for reified components created in other
   evaluation contexts even though method dispatch works on them (the
   documented SCI gotcha), so a reify reaching reconcile as a bare tree
   node crashes the render loop instead of splicing.

   The adapter is a transparent delegate over closures it does not own:
   nothing to cache (the wrapped component manages its own state), and
   its lifetime stays with ui-custom's dialog bookkeeping — trees never
   dispose it (foreign splice contract)."
