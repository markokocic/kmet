  "BashExecutionComponent — TUI component for displaying !/!! bash command execution
   with streaming output, expand/collapse, animated loader, duration, and status info.
   Port of pi's BashExecutionComponent.

   Hiccup implementation: a thin uncached record owns a state atom and a
   mounted fn-component root. The body re-derives only when the state (or
   the shared expansion toggle / theme) changes; the spliced spinner leaf
   re-renders fresh on every driven frame, so an 80ms frame driver animates
   it like pi's Loader setInterval while output chunks stream through the
   reaction."
