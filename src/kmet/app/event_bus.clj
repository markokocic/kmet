(def event-types
  "Map of event type keyword → description. The canonical vocabulary.
   Every listed event is emitted by the loop, the interactive mode, or the
   app — see each entry's description for the emitting path."
  {:agent-start
   "Fired once per user submission, before the first LLM call."

   :agent-end
   "Fired when the agent loop finishes (success or error).
    Payload: :messages (messages added during this loop), :error (optional)."

   :turn-start
   "Fired before each LLM call.
    Payload: :turn-index."

   "Fired after a turn completes (LLM call plus any tool execution).

    streaming begins.

   "Fired for each streaming delta (assistant only).
    Payload: :message (partial), :delta
    {:type :text | :thinking | :tool-call ...}."

   :message-end
   "Fired when an assistant message is finalized — added to context on
    success, or recorded in the session history only when the LLM call
    failed or was aborted (:stop-reason :error with :error-message, or
    :aborted; pi: message_end for a stopReason-error/aborted partial that
    _prepareRetry then drops from state). Payload: :message."

   "Fired when a tool execution begins.
    Payload: :tool-call-id, :tool-name, :args."

    registry is live, before the render loop starts (pi: session_start).
    Payload: :reason (:startup | :reload | :new | :resume | :fork),
    :previous-session-file (optional). Extensions use this to set up
    widgets, statuses, footers, and custom editors."

   :session-shutdown
   "Fired before the extension runtime is torn down — quit, reload, or
    session replacement (pi: session_shutdown, emitted by teardownCurrent /
    session.reload BEFORE the extensions are unloaded, so handlers can
    persist state while still alive). Payload: :reason (:reload | :new |
    :resume | :fork | :quit), :target-session-file (optional; the
    destination session on replacement). Extensions restore their state on
    the following :session-start."

    Payload: :preparation {:target-id :old-leaf-id :common-ancestor-id
    :entries-to-summarize :user-wants-summary :custom-instructions
    :replace-instructions :label}, :signal (abort atom). Handlers may return
    a map: {:cancel true} aborts the navigation, {:summary str :details …}

   "Fired when the conversation context is replaced: prepareNextTurn's
    :context update, or a compaction (auto or manual) rebuilding the context
    from the compacted session (pi: compaction_end re-renders the chat).

    retries; pi: compaction_end willRetry)."

   :agent-settled
   "Fired when the agent run is fully settled — immediately after :agent-end
    on every run exit (success, error, timeout, or cancel). The agent is idle
    and no further events for this run will be emitted (pi: agent_settled,

    results)."

   :before-provider-request

    handler result replaces the payload."

   :before-provider-headers
   "Fired with the final request headers before the provider HTTP call (pi:
    before_provider_headers — handlers mutate the map in place there; kmet's
    maps are immutable, so handlers RETURN the replacement map and a nil
    header value deletes that header). Payload: :headers. The last non-nil
