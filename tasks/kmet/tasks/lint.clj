  "The `lint` / `lint-changed` tasks: clj-kondo over BOTH reader views.

   kmet's .cljc files branch between its two hosts on the :bb and :jolt reader
   features (plain code is what both run; :clj — the JVM-ish dialect, matched
   by both hosts — is left for code that must not run on a non-JVM reader).
   clj-kondo resolves reader conditionals for the standard dialects only: it
   rejects :bb and :jolt as configured features and skips those tokens in a
   file, so a plain run never sees a host branch. kmet lints two views of the
   tree and merges the findings:

     babashka view — the tree, with every file carrying a :bb branch projected
       into target/bb-lint/ where :bb is re-spelled :clj (the one feature
       clj-kondo matches), under the project config: babashka's selection.
     jolt view — the files whose selection differs from a raw read — those
       carrying :jolt (projected the same way, under the .clj-kondo-jolt
       overlay) or :bb (read raw: clj-kondo skips an unknown feature exactly as
       jolt skips it) — plus jolt/ (jolt-only code the babashka view never
       reads): jolt's selection.

   The re-spelling reproduces each host exactly: the rewrite keeps branch
   order, and a reader takes the first matching branch in file order — jolt
   scans jolt/clj/default, clj-kondo the projection's single clj — so the same
   branch wins either way, whether the source pairs :jolt with a :clj branch
   or with a :default fallback. It rewrites feature keys only — a :bb in data,
   in a string or in a namespaced keyword is left alone — so the projection is
   the source with one feature
   renamed, and a :jolt one is padded to keep every following column in place
   (a :bb one grows its line by one: there is no 3-char feature clj-kondo
   knows). Findings therefore carry the real coordinates, and one both views
   produce compares equal — it is reported once. Mirrors live under target/
   (gitignored, never read as source) at stable paths, which is what lets
   clj-kondo's cache carry unchanged files over to the next run.

   BOTH `bb lint` and `jolt lint` run both views, so either gate alone covers
   common, babashka AND jolt code."
