  "Convention test: every component with a render method must either use
   track! with a :cache-atom (or legacy :cache) field, or be on the
   documented uncached allowlist.

   Rationale: an uncached component whose output changes while sitting above
   the render viewport triggers destructive full redraws during streaming
   (a mid-document line changing above the viewport — e.g. a time-animated
   elapsed counter — forces `\\u001b[3J`-emitting full redraws every frame,
   wiping the scrollback and re-emitting the whole transcript; on Windows
   Terminal it also yanks a scrolled-up reader to the top). track! makes the
   cache the default so volatile renders can only live in the two documented
   places: at the document bottom (spinner/status) or cached so they tick
   with real updates."
