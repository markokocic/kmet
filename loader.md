# kmet Loader — context/classloader interface (design + implementation plan)

Goal: one portable **Loader** abstraction that gives kmet's extension system
real isolation on every host — bb, JVM Clojure and Jolt — and that can be
promoted to a standalone library afterwards. It is the answer to the
**extension-isolation** workstream in `jolt-port.md` §B3 (a hard blocker for
the port).

Status: design locked; implementation staged (see §9). Nothing here is
implemented yet.

Related docs: `jar-ext.md` (extension artifact format — the loader it touches),
`jolt-port.md` §B3, `extensions/extensions.md` (the extension contract),
`src/kmet/tui/tui.md` (house style for a package reference doc).

## 0. Decisions locked (do not re-litigate in implementation)

1. **Protocol name `Loader`**, namespace `kmet.libs.loader`. Methods:
   `find`, `resolve`, `load`, `parent`, `unload!`. (`close` is the *host-view*
   spelling, see §6.4.)
2. **There is no hardcoded parent.** Delegation is a slot, implemented by a
   **resolve-fn**; `:parent` is sugar for one. Delegates are loaders
   themselves (`->loader` lifts a plain fn), so policies compose.
3. **The resolution body is generic**: *already-linked → delegate → locate
   (own roots/attachments) → miss*. The resolve-fn implements the **delegate
   step** only; it never links, installs or memoizes. Those are the generic
   body's job.
4. **Links are memoized, resources are not.** "Ask once, install the mapping,
   read the table thereafter" — a resolve-fn that answers differently at two
   moments is worse than none. Resources are re-walked every call (JVM
   semantics; caching them makes unload unobservable).
5. **`:denied` ≠ miss.** A blacklisted request raises; it must not fall
   through to another tier or to the ctx's own roots.
6. **Two resolution tiers**: *linkage* is directed by the **defining ctx**
   (lexical — code carries its loader, like the JVM's constant pool through
   the defining loader); *dynamic loading* (`require`/`eval` reached
   indirectly, REPL forms, framework resource probes) is directed by the
   **ambient ctx** (thread parameter, `with-loader`, TCCL analogue).
7. **Dispatch follows the value.** Protocol/`isa?`/`instance?`/record shape
   resolve through the ctx that *created* the value, regardless of which
   ctx's code is running. (JVM: virtual dispatch through the receiver's
   loader; static linkage through the referrer's.)
8. **Requests are typed**: `:ns`, `:var`, `:class`, `:resource` — because
   real loaders use different order and policy per kind.
9. **sci is the portable baseline on all three hosts**; native backends are
   upgrades layered on the same protocol, never a prerequisite. The same sci
   backend file serves bb/JVM/Jolt with a host seam for where bytes come from.
10. **`unload!` follows the Java `close` + OSGi `stop` precedent**: no new
    loads through the loader, already-resolved definitions stay live,
    acquired host resources are released, teardown errors are *reported*
    (never thrown), call is idempotent. Usage *after* unload throws. No
    unmapping, no refcounting; reclamation is "drop the references".
11. **Never call a user resolve-fn under a lock**; per-ctx, per-request
    in-flight marks (the JVM's `getClassLoadingLock` analogue) prevent
    recursive/double loads.
12. **Vocabulary is fixed**: `loader` = the abstraction; `context` = the
    host's own object underneath (sci ctx, jolt tables), reached via an
    escape hatch; `ClassLoader` = the host's real classloader, where one
    exists, reached via `as-classloader`.
13. **Hits are pure data; opening is the loader's job.** `find` locates and
    can be cached/compared/logged; nothing is read, compiled or opened until
    `load`, and a caller holding a hit can pass it to `load` to skip
    re-resolution (§4.4). `load` is the only place that reads.
14. **`unload!` never blocks** (the Java `close` contract); it records what
    it raced instead (§5). Blocking is an opt-in drain for later, if a
    consumer asks.
15. **Diagnostics**: `unloaded?` is the one behavioral predicate;
    `(status l)` is a map documented as implementation-visible (§4.5). No
    lifecycle enum — a transient `:unloading` state is only observable from
    another thread and any test for it is flaky.

## 1. Vocabulary

| word | means | where it appears |
|---|---|---|
| **loader** | the portable abstraction: resolve/link/find resources/unload | `Loader`, `(loader/…)` |
| **resolve-fn** | one implementation of the *delegate* step: answers what to find and where | ctx opts |
| **context** | the host object underneath (sci ctx, jolt ctx) | `(context l)` escape hatch |
| **ClassLoader** | a *real* host classloader, where the host has one | `(as-classloader l)` host view only |

`ClassLoader` never names the protocol. That keeps "ClassLoader-shaped, not
ClassLoader-compatible" enforceable rather than aspirational: you cannot
accidentally believe you have `defineClass` when the word only appears after
you have explicitly asked for a host view.

---

## 2. The resolution algorithm

```
linked?(ctx, req)                 ; the link table — what `resolve` answers from
  → delegate(ctx, req)            ; = resolve-fn (parent, pool, allow/deny, …)
  → locate(ctx, req)              ; own roots / attached artifacts (a hit)
  → miss

;; public mapping: `find` = linked? + delegate + locate, WITHOUT installing;
;; `resolve` = linked? only; `load` = the whole algorithm + read + initialize.
```

| step | who | memoized? |
|---|---|---|
| already linked in this ctx | generic body | yes (the link table) |
| delegate | **resolve-fn** (user code) | per §0.4: the *answer* is consulted once and installed |
| locate own roots | generic body via ctx's attached sources | yes, once linked; the **hit is data** (§4.4) |
| resources | delegate → own roots, in order | **no** — re-walked every call |

The JVM's own `ClassLoader.loadClass` is exactly this shape —
`findLoadedClass` → parent → `findClass` — verified: a `proxy` overriding
`findClass` is not consulted when the parent can answer, and is consulted for
a name only it can answer. Our design is that skeleton with the delegate
generalized from "a parent" to "a resolve-fn".

### What a resolve-fn answers, per kind

Answers are **hits** — data, never opened (§4.4).

- `:ns` → the source's **location** (file path / artifact entry) or
  "already linked in another loader" (by-reference delegation, §4.3)
- `:var` → the **var cell** (shared by reference — this is how
  `kmet.extension`, `kmet.tui.*`, `kmet.libs.*` are injected today)
- `:class` → a class registration/token (jolt) or a real `Class` (JVM)
- `:resource` → the resource's **location** (a URL or an embedded entry
  name — jolt has two kinds, and both open on demand); the loader wraps it
  with `open-hit`

### Policies (combinators, all trivial)

| combinator | meaning |
|---|---|
| `(->loader f)` | lift a plain resolve-fn into a delegate loader |
| `(delegating a b)` | try a then b (needs a total resolve-fn) |
| `(allow l #{'x})` / `(deny l #{'y})` | whitelist/blacklist over a delegate → `:denied` |
| `(self-first l #{'ns.prefix})` | own roots first for those names, delegate still consulted |
| `(isolated)` | `(constantly nil)` — hermetic; the root is not visible |
| `(pool [l1 l2])` | sibling sharing |
| `(url-search roots)` | the URLClassLoader analogue |

---

## 3. The two tiers

**Linkage — defining ctx (lexical).** Code compiled for ctx1 resolves
through ctx1 for its whole life, whoever calls it and on whatever thread.
This is the load-bearing rule: a function defined in ctx1 that lazily
`require`s something minutes later does it **in ctx1**, even when the host's
event loop calls it. A callback registered by ctx1 and driven by the root
still runs in ctx1. A macro defined in ctx1 expands in ctx1.

**Dynamic loading — ambient ctx.** Requests with no lexical home (`require`
reached indirectly, `eval`, REPL forms, framework resource probes) follow a
thread parameter (`with-loader`), inherited by threads and fibers. This is
the TCCL analogue and the weaker, best-effort tier.

On the JVM the same split exists: linkage goes through the defining loader
(constant pool), `RT.load`/`require` use `baseLoader`/TCCL.

**Limit to document, not fix**: dynamic loading reached through a value
(`(apply require […])`, a var holding `require`, `requiring-resolve`) cannot
carry the lexical ctx; it falls back to the ambient one. Emitted call sites
pass the ctx explicitly where the op is statically recognizable.

---

## 4. API

### 4.1 Protocol

```clojure
(ns kmet.libs.loader
  (:refer-clojure :exclude [find resolve load]))

(defprotocol Loader
  (find    [l req])   ; ordered hits, [] on miss, throws on :denied — LOCATES only
                      ; (no read, no compile, no open, no install); hits are data
  (resolve [l req])   ; the linked definition for this ctx from the link table,
                      ; or nil — does NOT read source, does not install
  (load    [l req])   ; resolve (or accept a hit) + READ + initialize + link;
                      ; returns the handle; the only method that reads
  (parent  [l])       ; the delegate loader, or nil (bootstrap/root)
  (unload! [l]))      ; idempotent, non-blocking; returns a report map;
                      ; never throws for teardown errors
```

The arity split *is* the semantics: `find` = `findClass`/`getResource`
(probe, no side effects), `resolve` = `findLoadedClass` + the loaded-classes
record (memoized definition, no I/O), `load` = `loadClass` + `RT.load`'s "also
evaluate". Someone who knows `ClassLoader` guesses all three correctly.

### 4.2 Constructors

```clojure
(loader/root)                       ; the host: today's global world, as a loader
(loader/classpath roots)            ; (url-search …) — n roots, in order
(loader/isolated)                   ; hermetic
(loader/delegating a b)             ; composed delegates
(loader/allow host #{'kmet.tui})    ; policy over a delegate
(loader/self-first host)
(context l)                         ; host escape hatch (sci ctx, jolt ctx)
(unloaded? l)                       ; post-unload predicate (§5)
(status l)                          ; diagnostics map (§4.5)
(open-hit l hit)                    ; hit → opened handle (§4.4)
(as-classloader l)                  ; host view where the host has one
```

### 4.3 Request and answer shapes

```clojure
;; request
{:kind :ns|:var|:class|:resource   ; required
 :name "clojure.string"            ; required (string, not symbol — hash-stable)
 :load? false}                     ; :ns only: load exactly like require, or load one namespace alone

;; hits (find → vector, ordered; first-wins for the singular forms)
;; DATA ONLY — no open streams, no closures, no compiled artifacts (see below)
{:kind :ns     :file "/roots/a/b.clj" :loader <who answered>}
{:kind :var    :cell <var-cell>}
{:kind :class  :registration {:class "java.time.Instant" :statics … :ctors …} :loader <l>}
{:kind :resource :url "file:/roots/a/cfg.edn" :loader <l>}

;; denied
(ex-info "…denied by policy…" {:loader/denied true :kind :ns :name "…"})
```

`:loader` on a hit exists for provenance/debug and for the cross-ctx
identity rules (§6). A `:var` hit carries the **cell**, so sharing is by
reference and `identical?` holds across ctxs — that is what the current
sci `:namespaces` injection relies on and it must not regress.

Resource hits name a **location** (`:url` or an embedded entry); the loader
turns it into an opened handle on demand, so nothing holds a stream or a
file handle between calls. An earlier draft put the opener fn *in the hit*
(`{:open (fn [] …)}`); that is rejected (§12.4) — a closure in a hit is not
printable, comparable or serializable, and it defeats the AOT/read-note
bookkeeping the opener must run. Hits stay data; the loader owns opening.

### 4.4 `find` locates, `load` reads

`find` finds *where* the source is; it does not read, compile or open it.
`load` does that, and is the **only** place a read happens:

```clojure
(load l req)   ; resolves (or reuses) the hit, reads, initializes, links
(load l hit)   ; accepts a hit directly — skips re-resolution, closes the
                ; TOCTOU window between find and load
(open-hit l hit)  ; resources: hit → an opened handle (stream/opener), or nil
```

Consequences, all of them good: hits are printable and comparable; errors
surface at `load`, where a read actually failed, rather than at a probe;
the loader's own **construction** is where eager validation lives (an
unreadable jar or a missing root fails at `(loader/classpath …)`, not at
first load); and the AOT read-note bookkeeping (jolt) stays inside the
loader instead of leaking into data.

This is also what jolt already does internally — `find-ns-file` locates,
`ldr-read-source` reads; `resolve-resource` returns a URL that opens on
demand — so the native backend maps onto it without rework.

### 4.5 `status` (diagnostics only)

```clojure
(status l)
;=> {:loader-id "ext:foo#3" :roots ["/w/foo/src"] :parent-loaded? true
;    :loaded-namespaces 12 :in-flight 1 :unloaded? false
;    :delegate <the parent's status, one level>}
```

The map is explicitly **implementation-visible**: keys may be added freely,
and no behavior may depend on a key that is not in this document. It exists
for debugging ("which loader still holds this namespace?") and for the
conformance suite. The only *behavioral* predicate is `unloaded?`.

---

## 5. `unload!` semantics

Precedent-checked against both systems:

- **Java `URLClassLoader.close`**: "no longer be used to load *new* classes or
  resources that are defined by this loader"; parents still accessible;
  "any classes or resources that are **already loaded**, are still
  accessible"; closes files it opened; "calling close on an already closed
  loader has **no effect**"; rethrows the first `IOException` with the rest
  suppressed.
- **OSGi** splits it in two: `stop` = deactivate (activator stop, framework
  auto-unregisters services/listeners, state → RESOLVED, restartable; bounds
  the wait and throws `BundleException` on timeout); `uninstall` = terminal
  UNINSTALLED while **"capabilities provided by the old in use bundle wirings
  must remain available … until the bundle is refreshed"**. A teardown
  failure during uninstall fires an ERROR event and uninstall still
  continues.

Both say the same thing, and it is the opposite of "yank the namespace out
from under existing code":

> unload = **no new loads through this loader** + release acquired host
> resources + report teardown errors. Already-resolved definitions stay live;
> reclamation is whoever-holds-references' business.

That is also the right behaviour for extensions specifically: an in-flight
agent turn, running timer, or async callback registered by the extension
keeps working after `/reload` swapped in the new revision (OSGi's
in-use-wirings guarantee).

```clojure
;; Idempotent. Never throws for teardown failures — reports them.
;; NEVER BLOCKS: it marks closed first (so new loads fail fast) and lets an
;; in-flight load finish; "finish" means it may complete into a closed
;; loader, which is well-defined below.
{:unloaded true      ; postcondition held: no new loads, resources released
 :already  false     ; true on the second call
 :released {:namespaces 12 :resources 3 :registrations 5}  ; best-effort counts
 :in-flight 1        ; loads still running when the mark was set
 :raced    true      ; true iff any load was in flight (see below)
 :errors   []}       ; teardown errors, in order (Java's suppressed, as data)
```

- **Report, don't throw.** Symmetric with `load-extension!`'s
  `{:extension … :error …}`, which `/reload` already collects and renders.
- **Never blocks** (decision 14). Java's own contract is "if another thread
  is loading a class when close is invoked, then the result of that load is
  undefined"; OSGi's bounded wait is rejected here because on jolt a wait
  would park inside `loader.ss`'s claim protocol (§7), and because kmet's
  `/reload` already refuses to run while the agent is busy
  (`interactive.clj` "Wait for the current response to finish before
  reloading"), which serializes the extension path by construction.
- **An in-flight load completing into a closed loader is defined, not
  undefined**: the load finishes and its definitions stay usable
  (already-loaded resources remain accessible, per Java), but it does not
  re-open the loader — the next `find`/`resolve`/`load` still throws.
  `:raced` exists so a caller that cares can detect it.
- **But usage after unload throws** (OSGi's rule, better than the JVM's
  `NoClassDefFoundError`/empty enumerations): `find`/`resolve`/`load` on an
  unloaded loader → `IllegalStateException`.
- Two things deliberately **not** promised: a "live references remaining"
  count (not computable on jolt's var cells; a lie on at least one host) and
  a boolean return (`nil` loses diagnostics, `false` implies unload can
  fail — it cannot; the postcondition always holds).
- **Opt-in drain, later**: `{:drain-ms N}` if a post-promotion consumer asks.
  It needs its own analysis against jolt's non-recursive loader mutex and
  in-flight claim marks before it can be offered (it must never wait while
  holding loader state).
- Ordering, matching OSGi: **shutdown → deregister → `unload!`**. kmet's
  existing `unload-extension!` already does exactly this.

Mapping:

| OSGi | Java | here |
|---|---|---|
| `BundleActivator.stop` | — | extension `shutdown` (called before unload) |
| `Bundle.stop` (deactivate/unregister) | `URLClassLoader.close` | `unload!` |
| `Bundle.uninstall` (terminal, remove storage) | — | out of scope v1 (`remove!` later if a loader owns files) |
| `Bundle.getState` | — | `(unloaded? l)` + `(status l)` |
| in-use wirings stay live | "already loaded … still accessible" | same rule |

---

## 6. Hosts and backends

| host | sci backend | native backend | what native adds | what native cannot do |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **bb** | ✓ (what kmet does today) | ✗ | — | `proxy` whitelist rejects `java.lang.ClassLoader`; `URLClassLoader`/`DynamicClassLoader` ctors throw `MissingReflectionRegistrationError`; `Thread.setContextClassLoader` throws `ClassCastException` (verified) |
| **JVM Clojure** | ✓ | ✓ `proxy [ClassLoader]` | real `Class` objects, `defineClass`, jar handles, `Class/forName(name,false,l)` | **no namespace isolation** — `clojure.lang.Namespace`/Var tables are per-runtime (needs a second `clojure.jar`, which breaks value identity across the boundary) |
| **Jolt** | ✓ (`vendor/sci`; `make sci` 412/424, `scifunctional` green) | ✓ native ctx | compiled (not interpreted) extensions; full ns+class+resource isolation; unload | no `defineClass` bytecode path — a class is a name + registration; boot `java.*` classes stay global |

**sci is the portability baseline, not a fallback**: every host can run it, so
every host gets the same semantics for free. The generic backend is one
implementation with a host seam for *where bytes come from*
(`babashka.classes`/resource on bb, classpath on the JVM,
`jolt.host/ns-source` on jolt) and the **share list** supplied by the app
layer (the lib must not know `kmet.extension`/`kmet.tui.*`/`kmet.libs.*`).

Verified JVM facts (probed, not assumed): `proxy [java.lang.ClassLoader]`
works and is the only viable route — `defineClass` is protected/final and
**not reachable via Clojure reflection** (`No matching method defineClass`),
so a Java shim (or `DynamicClassLoader`) is required for that one method;
overridden `getResource`/`getResources` are seen by `clojure.java.io/resource`
and `Class/forName(name, false, l)`.

### 6.1 Jolt native backend

Jolt already has the *shape*: `the-classloader` is a `jhost` record with a
registered method table (`getResource`, `getResources`, `getParent` → nil,
`getResourceAsStream` — `host/chez/java/io.ss:1492`), `getSystemClassLoader`,
`clojure.lang.RT/baseLoader` (io.ss:1546) and `Thread.getContextClassLoader`
(io.ss:1624) all return it, `java.lang.ClassLoader` is already in the class
hierarchy (`class-hierarchy.ss:864`), and `resolve-resource` (io.ss:1438) is
the single resource funnel. It is one global object; the work is making it
per-ctx and wiring the compiler to it.

Evolution stages are M0–M4 (§9 Phase 3); the subsections below are the
detailed design for that work.

#### 6.1.1 Naming: "ctx" is taken inside jolt

`host-contract.ss:20` already has `chez-actx` — the *analyze* context — and
`make-analyze-ctx` (host-contract.ss:21) is constructed at
`compile-eval.ss:459,619`, `emit-image.ss:252,336,368`, `build.ss:690` and
host-contract.ss:947. Use **`chez-loader`** for the host-side loader record
and `*loader*`/`current-loader` for the ambient binding, so "ctx" keeps
meaning what it means today in that tree.

The analyze ctx **gains a `loader` field** (defaulted to the root loader):
`hc-resolve-cell` (host-contract.ss:233) and `hc-resolve-global`
(host-contract.ss:489) then consult the loader's link tables instead of the
globals — one field, defaulted, at a record already threaded everywhere.

#### 6.1.2 State inventory

| state | site | native scope | stage |
|---|---|---|---|
| `var-table`, `ns-cells-index`, `ns-has-vars-set` | rt.ss:893,939,1137 | per-ctx | M0 |
| `ns-registry` | ns.ss:22 | per-ctx | M0 |
| `ns-alias-table`, `ns-refer-table`, `ns-refer-all-table`, `-exclude-table`, `ns-core-exclude-table` | ns.ss:44–150 | per-ctx | M0 |
| `source-roots`, `ldr-ns-replacements` | loader.ss:15,101 | per-ctx | M1 |
| `rdr-features`, `*data-readers*` scan | reader.ss:984, loader.ss:126 | per-ctx (read-time) | M1 |
| `loaded-ns` + load state/claims | loader.ss:385,1463 | per-ctx | M1 |
| AOT memos, read notes | loader.ss:599–955 | per-ctx | M3 |
| `class-statics-tbl`, `class-ctors-tbl`, `host-methods-tbl`, `mutable-statics-tbl` | host-static.ss:26,60,150,309 | per-ctx (boot classes on root) | M2 |
| class extensions | class-extensions.ss | per-ctx | M2 |
| provider tables: `lib-class-providers`, `lib-pending-claims-tbl`, `lib-provider-owned-tbl`, latches | host-static.ss:337–700 | per-ctx | M2 |
| `type-registry`, `jolt-proto-epoch`, record descriptors | protocols.ss:66,143; records*.ss | per-ctx | M2 |
| `global-hierarchy`, multimethod tables | refs (clojure.core var), multimethods.ss | per-ctx + dispatch rule (§6.1.5) | M2 |
| `jch` class hierarchy, reader builtins, embedded source store | class-hierarchy.ss, reader.ss, loader.ss | **global** (boot) | — |
| `*ns*`, dyn bindings, current source/positions | dyn-binding.ss, compile-eval.ss | per-thread (unchanged) | — |

#### 6.1.3 The pipeline: where the loader plugs in

read → analyze → emit → eval, with one funnel already in place:

- **eval**: `jolt-compile-eval-form` / `-*` (compile-eval.ss:660,665) is the
  single top-level entry — bind the ambient loader here (M1);
  `jolt-compile-eval` (compile-eval.ss:714) and `load-string` follow.
- **analyze**: the analyze ctx carries the loader (§6.1.1). Resolution reads
  the loader's tables: cells, aliases, refers (hc-resolve-cell), classes
  (hc-resolve-global), and — on a miss — the loader's provider latch (M2).
- **read**: `resolve-on-roots`/`find-ns-file`/`ldr-read-source`
  (loader.ss:340–380) walk the loader's roots; `rdr-features` bind per read.
- **emit**: `host-static-call`/`host-static-ref`
  (backend_scheme.clj:2712–2715,3063) take a ctx when the form needs one
  (§6.1.4); var sites are already hoisted (`hoist-var-cell`,
  backend_scheme.clj:1010–1030).
- **load**: `load-namespace`/`require` (loader.ss) run against the loader;
  the call site passes it or falls back to ambient (§6.1.4).

#### 6.1.4 Two mechanisms: ambient loader + defining capture

**Ambient** (thread parameter, like `chez-current-ns`): bound around the
analyze+eval of each top-level form and around each file load (M1). This
covers *everything that happens during the defining evaluation* — nested
requires, data readers, `deftype`/`defrecord` registration, `defmethod`,
`register-class-statics!`, provider autoload, `intern`. Those host fns read
`(current-loader)` at load time and land in the defining loader without any
API change: the def's init runs inside the ctx by construction.

**Defining capture** covers code that runs *later*. It rides the existing
per-def cell scope: `emit-with-cells` (backend_scheme.clj:694–712) already
wraps a def's init in `let*` for the const pool and hoisted cells — add one
more binding, read once at def time:

```scheme
(define jv$foo
  (let* ((_ctx$N (current-loader))   ; NEW — same let*, same pool
         (cell$1 (jolt-var "ns" "dep")))
    (lambda (x) (host-static-call _ctx$N "Foo" "bar" cell$1 x))))
```

Correctness: the def-init evaluates *inside* the defining loader, so
`(current-loader)` at that moment is the right one; nested lambdas close over
it through ordinary lexical scope, and re-evaluating the def in another
loader rebinds it. A closure created later (a fn returned from a fn) still
closes over the outer def's `_ctx$N`.

**Screening** (the cost gate): walk the IR and bind `_ctx$N` only when the
form contains `:host-static`/`:host-new`/`:host-static-ref`, a **non-hoisted**
`:var` site (the `var-cache?`-off paths — seed mint, some built images), or a
direct call to a dynamic-load var (`require`, `load`, `load-file`,
`requiring-resolve`, `eval`). Plain arithmetic/seq closures emit byte-identically
to today. Expect this to be the same shape as the existing `repeat-ops`
gate (backend_scheme.clj:740) — a predicate, not a rewrite.

**Where capture is impossible** (documented degradation, same as Clojure's
`baseLoader`): `(apply require …)`, a var holding `require`, a
`requiring-resolve` reached indirectly. Those use the ambient loader.

**Seed-fixpoint constraint**: the seed mint runs with `set-var-cache!` off
(backend_scheme.clj:232) and must stay byte-deterministic — the `_ctx$N`
binding follows `*const-pool*` (backend_scheme.clj:559), so it must be emitted
only under the same conditions the mint already tolerates. Gate: `selfhost`,
`make remint`.

#### 6.1.5 Classes, providers, types

- **Boot globals** (shared by delegation, as on the JVM): the core providers
  `jolt.time.base` / `jolt.socket` (host-static.ss:337), the `jch` hierarchy,
  every class the runtime implements (`String`, `Base64`, …).
- **Per-loader**: `class-statics-tbl`/`class-ctors-tbl`/`host-methods-tbl`,
  mutable statics, class extensions, `type-registry` + protocol epoch +
  record descriptors, and the RFC 0014 tables — `lib-class-providers`,
  `lib-pending-claims-tbl`, `lib-provider-owned-tbl`, the one-shot latches.
  `register-class-provider!` (and `main.clj:101`'s
  `register-class-providers!`) targets the loader being created; boot
  providers register on the root.
- **Provider autoload** (`lib-try-autoload!`, host-static.ss §600–700) consults
  the loader's pending table, and the install namespace loads *in that
  loader*; `provider-claim-drop!`/`hold!` keep their meaning per loader.
- **Cross-loader identity**: two loaders' "same" class/type give distinct
  tokens; `instance?`/`=` across them is false on purpose (§6.3).
- **Dispatch is value-directed** (§0.7): `isa?`/`instance?` derive the loader
  from their (tagged) arguments, not from the caller. Each loader has its own
  hierarchy; a `derive` in loader A is invisible to loader B. Multimethod
  tables need nothing extra — a `multifn` lives in a var cell, and cells are
  per-loader — except for multimethods defined in *shared* (root) namespaces,
  which stay shared as expected. Until M2 lands, derives leak through the
  global `global-hierarchy` cell: record it as a divergence and have
  `run-case-isolation.ss`'s reset as the stopgap.

#### 6.1.6 Load protocol, concurrency, fibers

- The loader's claim protocol (loader.ss:1463–1936: `ldr-load-mu`, marks,
park/wake, cycle detection, `ldr-mark-loaded!`/`ldr-unmark-loaded!` at
1211/1216, rollback at 1888) is keyed **(loader, namespace)** — one mark per
loader, so two loaders may load the same namespace concurrently and each
rolls back independently.
- Lock discipline is preserved, not relaxed: the "a LOAD MUST NEVER ACQUIRE
`stm-lock`" rule and the `ldr-libs-mu` ordering (loader.ss:440–470) stay;
per-loader mutexes remove cross-loader serialization but every existing edge
remains. `make lock-check` / `park-lock-check` are the gates.
- **Fibers**: a load can park (fiber backend), and `dyn-binding.ss` documents
why thread parameters alone are not enough across a fiber resume (the winder
pushes a second frame). The ambient loader must survive a fiber parking and
resuming on a different carrier — this is the one jolt-internal mechanism
that needs an explicit test (case 9 executed from a `go` block). Reuse
whatever `chez-current-ns` does; if it is insufficient, the loader binding
needs the same push/pop treatment the dynamic bindings have.

#### 6.1.7 Resources and the ClassLoader facade

- `resolve-resource` (io.ss:1438) resolves within the ambient loader's roots;
  `io-note-file-read!` records into that loader's AOT notes.
- `the-classloader` becomes `(loader->classloader l)` — a `jhost` carrying the
  loader in its state (like the thread handle carries its id, io.ss:1596), so
  `getResource`/`getResources`/`getResourceAsStream` resolve in *that* loader
  and `getParent` returns the delegate's facade (nil at root).
- Statics: `getSystemClassLoader` → root's facade; `RT/baseLoader` → ambient
  loader's facade; `Thread.getContextClassLoader` (io.ss:1624) → ambient;
  `Class.getClassLoader` → the loader that registered the class (carried on
  the class registration).
- `io/resource`'s 2-arity (io.ss:1466: "jolt has a single \"classloader\" …
  so the argument is accepted and ignored") becomes meaningful: an argument
  that is one of our loader jhosts resolves in its loader; any other value (a
  library passing some real loader object) keeps today's ambient behavior.

#### 6.1.8 deps and entry points

`jolt.deps/resolve-deps` (deps.clj:1016) is already the per-loader root
resolver. `apply-project!` (main.clj:120) becomes "build the project loader
from the resolved map":

```clojure
{:roots … :provides … :replaces … :features … :natives …}
  → (make-loader …)   ; roots → source search; provides → claims; …
```

The root loader is the install roots (loader.ss:38 `ldr-install-roots`).
jolt.host seams to extend or re-target: `set-source-roots!`/`source-roots`,
`ns-source`, `load-namespace`, `replace-builtin-ns!`,
`add-reader-features!`, `register-class-provider!` (loader argument),
`ctx-for-ns` (host-contract.ss:947). New host vars need
`jolt-host-manifest.txt` lines and `make manifestcheck`:
`current-loader`, `with-loader` (if hosted), `loader-roots`,
`loader-classloader`, `unload-loader!`.

#### 6.1.9 Gotchas (all verified in-tree)

- **Gates that will fail if forgotten**: `make manifestcheck` (any new
  `jolt.host` var); `make gambitgen`/`gambitgencheck` (`host/gambit/rt-core.ss`
  mirrors rt.ss, `records-gambit.ss` mirrors records.ss via
  `gen-records.ss` — M0/M2 touch both mirrors); `make mirror-drift-check`;
  `make portability-check`, `dead-host-check`, `lock-check`,
  `park-lock-check` on the M0–M2 host edits; `make remint` only if a
  seed-listed file changes (only `reader.ss` among these is on the seed list —
  but an accidental `jolt-core/**` or `clojure.core` edit is not).
- **AOT cache (M3)**: `aot-cacheable-file` (loader.ss:947) resolves through
  the *global* `find-ns-file` — must resolve within the loader;
  `aot-own-key-memo` is keyed by namespace name — key it by
  (loader, namespace) or by resolved file; `:jolt/features` /
  `:jolt/replaces` fold into the key (they change what was *compiled*).
- **Embedded sources**: `embedded-resource-has?`/`resolve-on-roots`
  (loader.ss:340–360) key by root-relative path — two roots holding
  `foo/bar.clj` collide. Root-qualify the keys, or declare multi-root
  loaders source-mode-only in v1.
- **Tree shaking**: `dce.ss` walks `get-source-roots` — build-time, today
  single-loader; a multi-loader build needs the closure walked per loader.
  Note it, don't build it in v1.
- **State images**: closures are name references
  (`register-code-value!`/state-image.ss:70–74). An image restored in a
  different loader would resolve names in the wrong one — record the home
  loader, or refuse a cross-loader restore.
- **Direct linking**: a `direct-link?` build emits bare Scheme bindings for
  app fns (`dl-name`, backend_scheme.clj:3284+), which are loader-independent
  by construction. Multi-loader evaluation must therefore run with
  direct-linking off (runtime eval already is; a *built* multi-loader app is
  not expressible in v1 — record it).
- **Natives stay global**: `dlopen` is process-wide and jolt dedupes
  `:jolt/native` by name (deps.clj:1683) — two loaders' lib versions share one
  `.so`. Declare it; anything with per-version C state is out of scope.

#### 6.1.10 Stages, files, gates

| stage | content | files | gates |
|---|---|---|---|
| **M0** indirection | `chez-loader` record owning the M0 rows of §6.1.2; accessors read `(current-loader)`; root loader wraps today's globals; analyze ctx gains the field (defaulted) | rt.ss, ns.ss, host-contract.ss, compile-eval.ss, emit-image.ss, build.ss, loader.ss | `corpus` `unit` `cts` `sbperf` + `manifestcheck` + `gambitgencheck` + `mirror-drift-check`; `remint` only if a seed-listed file was touched |
| **M1** loaders + propagation | ambient binding at the eval funnel; per-loader roots/loaded-ns/data-readers; defining capture in `emit-with-cells` + screening; `find`/`resolve`/`load` split mapped onto `resolve-on-roots`/link table/`load-namespace` | loader.ss, compile-eval.ss, backend_scheme.clj, reader.ss | above + suite cases 1,2,3,5,6,9,10 (9 from a `go` block too) |
| **M2** classes | per-loader class/provider/type tables; value-directed dispatch; ctx-tagged tokens; divergence entry | host-static.ss, protocols.ss, records*.ss, multimethods.ss, class-hierarchy.ss (read-only) | above + cases 4,10 + provider autoload inside a loader |
| **M3** unload + caches | teardown against the `run-case-isolation.ss` list; AOT/embedded/class-path fixes from §6.1.9 | loader.ss, io.ss, build.ss, dce.ss | case 7, 11, 12 + world byte-compare + `aot-cache-smoke` |
| **M4** host API | per-loader classloader jhost, `RT/baseLoader`, TCCL, `io/resource` 2-arity, `jolt.host` seams (§6.1.8) + `as-classloader` | io.ss, loader.ss, main.clj, jolt.deps.clj | full suite on jolt + `sci`/`scifunctional` stay green |

Each stage is independently mergeable and each must keep the sci backend's
suite green: the native backend is an upgrade layered on the same protocol,
never a second semantics.

### 6.2 Per-ctx deps resolution

**Not the loader's job.** A loader receives its roots/sources; resolving a
`deps.edn` to roots is a host seam: `borkdude.deps` on bb/JVM (today's
`closure-jars`/`jars-for`), `jolt.deps/resolve-deps` on jolt (which already
returns `{:roots … :natives … :provides … :libs …}` per graph). The loader
backend takes an injected resolve-deps fn. Version-qualified extraction dirs
already make v1/v2 coexist on disk in both systems.

### 6.3 Cross-ctx identity rules (write down, don't discover later)

- Two ctxs loading "the same" class/type ⇒ distinct tokens; `instance?`/`=`
  across them is **false** on purpose (JVM: `ClassCastException`).
- Var cells from a *shared* loader are the same object (by-reference
  injection relies on it).
- Dispatch follows the value (§0.7).

### 6.4 `as-classloader`

Where the host has a real `ClassLoader`, expose one: `loadClass` → `find` +
`load`; `getResource(s)`/`getResourceAsStream` → `find` then `open-hit`;
`getParent` → `(parent l)`'s facade; `close` → `unload!`. On the JVM this is
a `proxy [ClassLoader]`. On jolt, the per-ctx `jhost` loader with the method
table above, which also makes `(io/resource n loader)`'s currently-ignored
2-arity argument start meaning something, and keeps
`(take-while identity (iterate #(.getParent %) l))` terminating.

### 6.5 Which sci artifact (jolt)

bb has `sci.core` built in — nothing to add. Jolt needs one of: the maven
`org.borkdude/sci` (unverified that the *published jar* loads on jolt — the
`make sci` gate proves the **vendored** copy only), a git pin (kmet already
pins two jolt-lang git coordinates in `deps.edn`, so this is house style),
or vendoring sci into kmet. **Pick the git pin**, matching the revision
family the sci gate exercises, and verify early — it is the one unproven
assumption in Phase 1. `kmet.libs.loader.sci` carries the requirement in its
own namespace file, so a consumer that requires only `kmet.libs.loader` never
loads sci at runtime (Clojure namespace laziness); the dep is classpath-only
for them.

---

## 7. Concurrency and lifecycle rules

- **Never call a resolve-fn under a lock** — it may `require` into the same
  ctx (cycle). Per-ctx, per-request in-flight marks; a nested load on the
  same thread must be detected, not deadlocked. Reuse the loader's existing
  claim protocol on jolt; `getClassLoadingLock` semantics elsewhere.
- **A ctx is inherited** by threads/fibers spawned inside it (ambient tier).
  Linkage needs nothing — it is lexical.
- **Unload does not unmap** (§5). Drop references; the host reclaims.
- **State images / serialized closures**: a closure that travels through a
  state image is a name reference, not a value. In a multi-ctx world an
  image must record its home ctx, or cross-ctx restore must be refused.
  (Jolt-only concern; cheap to enforce early.)

---

## 8. Conformance suite (this list *is* the spec)

Host-agnostic, written against the protocol; must pass on every backend.

1. **v1/v2 isolation** — two ctxs, one mvn lib at v1 and v2: `ctx1/foo` ≠
   `ctx2/foo`, both correct.
2. **Hermetic** — `(isolated)`: a name the root has must **not** resolve.
3. **Shared by reference** — delegate a var: the **same cell** comes back
   (`identical?`), not a copy.
4. **Deny ≠ miss** — denying a name raises, and does not fall through to the
   ctx's own roots.
5. **Self-first** — a ctx shadows a lib its delegate also has, for the
   declared prefix only.
6. **Composed delegates** — host + pool; `(parent …)` walks the graph.
7. **Unload** — post-condition holds (no new loads), already-resolved
   definitions still work, second `unload!` is a no-op, usage after unload
   throws, teardown errors are reported not thrown.
8. **Resources** — `find`/`open-hit`/`getResource(s)`/`getResourceAsStream`
   against a ctx root; `RT/baseLoader` (or the host equivalent) inside the
   ctx resolves to the ctx's loader; the 2-arity `io/resource` honors the
   loader.
9. **Defining-ctx inheritance** — ctx1 defines `f` that lazily requires
   `lib1`; ctx2 (with a different `lib1`) *calls* `f`; assert `f` saw
   **ctx1's** `lib1`.
10. **Dispatch follows the value** — a value created in ctx2, passed to ctx1
    code, still dispatches through ctx2's type tables.
11. **Hits are data** — `find` opens nothing (a hit survives `pr-str` and `=`;
    probing a loader leaves no file handles), and `(load l hit)` on a hit
    from `find` produces the same result as `(load l req)`.
12. **Eager construction, lazy load** — a loader built on an unreadable
    root/jar fails at the constructor; a *load* that reads a file that
    disappeared after `find` fails at `load`, not silently.

Cases 1–8, 11 are expressible on bb against sci **today**, which is the
point: pin the semantics before any runtime work, the way the corpus does
for `clojure.core`.

---

## 9. Implementation plan

Order follows the user-visible payoff, not the elegance: the protocol + sci
backend deliver extension isolation on all hosts first; native backends are
upgrades that must satisfy the same suite.

### Phase 0 — protocol, policies, suite (no kmet integration yet)

- `src/kmet/libs/loader.clj` — protocol, request/answer shapes, combinators
  (`->loader`, `delegating`, `allow`, `deny`, `self-first`, `isolated`,
  `pool`, `url-search`), `with-loader`/`current-loader`, link table,
  in-flight marks, generic `find`/`resolve`/`load` body, `open-hit`,
  `unloaded?`/`status`, `unload!` report.
- `src/kmet/libs/loader/memory.clj` (ns `kmet.libs.loader.memory`) — an
  in-memory loader over a source map, used by the suite and as the demo
  loader (no sci yet).
- `test/kmet/libs/test_loader.clj` (ns `kmet.libs.test-loader`) — cases 1–8,
  10 (case 9 needs a code backend). Register in `kmet.runner/all-namespaces`.
- Gate: `bb test-changed`, `bb lint-changed`, `bb format-check-changed`.
- Constraint: `kmet.libs.test-self-contained` must stay green — no app deps.

### Phase 1 — sci backend + kmet extension wiring (all hosts, sci)

- `src/kmet/libs/loader/sci.clj` (ns `kmet.libs.loader.sci`; the file+dir
  layout already has precedent in `kmet.app.ui`) — a Loader whose generic
  body delegates
  compile/eval to sci (`:load-fn`, `:namespaces`, `:classes`), with the
  **share list injected** by the caller. Requires `sci.core` only where the
  dep exists (bb built-in / JVM maven / jolt `vendor/sci` local root);
  document the reader-conditional.
- `src/kmet/app/extensions.cljc` — replace `create-context` +
  `make-load-fn` + `jars-for` plumbing with `loader/sci` + policies
  (`allow` over the root for the shared layers; per-extension deps resolver
  injected). `load-extension!` / `unload-extension!` keep their shape
  (`{:extension … :error …}`; shutdown → deregister → `unload!`).
  The four `"Extensions not supported on Jolt"` guards collapse into backend
  selection.
- `src/kmet/extension.clj` — **re-export** the loader constructors the
  contract promises, so extensions never import `kmet.libs.loader` directly
  (this is what keeps promotion non-breaking).
- Tests: existing extension/jar-ext tests stay green; add case 1 (v1/v2)
  as a real extension fixture; case 9 on sci.
- Gate: `bb test-changed` (plus `bb test` for the extensions suites if
  touched broadly), `bb format-check-changed`.

### Phase 2 — JVM native backend + hybrid

- `kmet.libs.loader.jvm` (Clojure-only): `proxy [java.lang.ClassLoader]`
  overriding `findClass`/`getResource(s)`/`findResources`; `parent` from the
  proxy's own parent; `close`/`unload!` mapped both ways;
  `as-classloader` returns the proxy itself.
- **Java shim** for `defineClass` (or `DynamicClassLoader`) if class
  definition is needed — reflection cannot reach it (verified).
- `loader/hybrid` — native classloader for `:class`/`:resource` + attached
  sci ctx for `:ns`/`:var`; documented as the only way to get both kinds of
  isolation on the JVM.
- Suite runs on the JVM for cases 1–8, 10; case 3 (shared var) via the sci
  half.

### Phase 3 — Jolt native backend

**Detailed design and per-stage file/gate lists: §6.1** (state inventory
§6.1.2, the two ctx-propagation mechanisms §6.1.4, gotchas §6.1.9, stage
table §6.1.10). Summary:

Depends on the port reaching the extension system (`jolt-port.md` §B3);
phases 0–2 already give Jolt isolation through sci.

- **M0 — indirection, zero behaviour change.** Tables move behind a
  `chez-loader` record; accessors read the ambient loader; the root loader
  wraps today's globals; the analyze ctx gains a defaulted `loader` field.
  ~100 sites, ~10 files. Also `manifestcheck`, `gambitgencheck`,
  `mirror-drift-check`; `remint` only if a seed-listed file was touched.
- **M1 — loaders + ctx propagation.** Ambient binding at the eval funnel;
  per-loader roots/loaded-ns/data readers; defining capture in
  `emit-with-cells` + IR screening; `find`/`resolve`/`load` mapped onto
  `resolve-on-roots` / the link table / `load-namespace`; resolve-fn as the
  delegate step.
- **M2 — classes per loader.** Registry tables, class extensions, provider
  claims/latches, type/protocol tables; boot `java.*` global; ctx-tagged
  tokens; value-directed dispatch; divergence entry for cross-loader
  identity (and, until then, the hierarchy leak).
- **M3 — unload + caches.** The `run-case-isolation.ss` snapshot/prune list
  as the checklist; shared-write ledger (class extensions, hierarchy
  derives); AOT/embedded/class-path fixes (§6.1.9).
- **M4 — host API + loader objects.** Per-loader `the-classloader`,
  `RT/baseLoader`, TCCL, `(io/resource n loader)` honoring its argument,
  `jolt.host` seams (§6.1.8), `as-classloader`.
- Gates per M-stage: the corpus/unit/cts/sbperf set (plus the jolt gates in
  §6.1.9) and the conformance cases named in §6.1.10; `make sci` /
  `scifunctional` must stay green throughout — they pin the sci path the
extension backend uses.

### Phase 4 — promotion to a standalone library

- Move `kmet.libs.loader*` (+ its doc and suite) out unchanged; add its own
  `deps.edn`. Because `kmet.libs.*` is already "a third-party library on the
  JVM" by project rule and extensions only ever see `kmet.extension`'s
  re-exports, promotion is a rename + a root — no API break.
- jolt's `stdlib/jolt/loader.clj` (native backend) moves/stays jolt-side;
  the JVM backend stays a separate artifact.

---

## 10. Rollout order and validation

1. Phase 0 green on bb (fast, no kmet behavior change).
2. Phase 1 on bb: `/reload`, extension fixtures, jar-ext suites unchanged.
3. Phase 1 on Jolt: `jolt -e "(require 'kmet.libs.loader)"`, the suite, then
   kmet's extension tests (once the port reaches them).
4. Phase 2 JVM, Phase 3 Jolt native — each must pass the *same* suite; a
   native backend that fails a case is a bug in the backend, not a
   permitted divergence (§6.3 excepted, recorded in the registry).
5. Changed-file gates (`bb test-changed` / `lint-changed` /
   `format-changed`) during development; full gates only on request
   (AGENTS.md).

## 11. Non-goals (v1)

- Bytecode definition on non-JVM hosts (`defineClass` is JVM-only; on jolt
  "define" = register a class token).
- Real `Class` objects / `ClassCastException` / verifier semantics outside
  the JVM.
- Namespace isolation on the JVM without sci or a second `clojure.jar`.
- Sandboxing: contexts are not a security boundary — anything shared by
  reference is fully mutable by the child (same caveat as today's sci
  injection).
- Per-context reader features / replaces policy beyond what a ctx's loader
  already carries (record the policy change when M1 lands).

## 12. Resolved questions (alternatives considered, kept for the record)

### 12.1 Where the sci backend lives / how the dep arrives — **A**

*Decision*: a direct `sci.core` require in `kmet.libs.loader.sci` (its own
namespace file); jolt gets sci via a git pin (§6.5). Protocol-only consumers
pay nothing at runtime — requiring `kmet.libs.loader` does not load
`loader.sci` — and the only cost is a classpath entry.

Note the premise: `kmet.libs` is *not* "no third-party deps". The
self-contained guard only forbids `kmet.*` requires outside `kmet.libs.*`,
and `deps.edn` already carries `babashka.http-client`, `deps.clj`,
`data.json` and two jolt-lang git deps; `kmet.libs.http` requires
`babashka.http-client` today. "Dep-light" is a promotion-quality argument,
not an enforced rule.

| alt | pros | cons | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A: direct dep, own ns** | simplest; one home; matches `libs.http`; namespace laziness isolates the cost | jolt needs a sci artifact (git pin) | **chosen** |
| B: injected backend SPI | lib truly dep-free; impls evolve separately | a second contract designed and documented before anyone needs it | rejected — premature abstraction |
| C: impl in the app layer | zero new libs deps | promotion becomes a move, not a rename; loader code in two layers now | rejected |
| D: dynamic `requiring-resolve` | no classpath change | missing dep surfaces at first use, not load; contradicts fail-early | rejected — anti-pattern |

### 12.2 `unload!` blocking — **never block** (A), report the race

*Decision*: mark closed first (new loads fail fast), let an in-flight load
finish and stay usable, record `:in-flight`/`:raced` in the report. Opt-in
`{:drain-ms N}` later, only with its own analysis against jolt's
non-recursive loader mutex and claim marks.

| alt | pros | cons | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A: best-effort / undefined (JVM)** | trivial; exactly `URLClassLoader.close`'s contract | post-promotion footgun unless the race is *reported* | **chosen + `:raced`** |
| B: bounded drain (OSGi) | predictable; catches late lazy `require`s | timeout knob + failure mode; on jolt a wait parks inside the claim protocol (deadlock risk); needs slow/timing tests | deferred (opt-in later) |
| C: refuse if busy | no waiting; matches kmet's `/reload` refusal; caller decides | racy (busy is momentary); caller would need a retry loop anyway | rejected as the contract |
| D: force + discard late results | never blocks; deterministic postcondition | partial-install rollback is genuinely complex | rejected |

Mitigating fact for A: `/reload` already refuses while the agent is busy
(`interactive.clj` "Wait for the current response to finish before
reloading"), so the extension path is serialized by construction today.

### 12.3 State exposure — **`unloaded?` + `(status l)`**

*Decision*: `unloaded?` is the only behavioral predicate; `(status l)` is a
map documented as implementation-visible and free to grow keys (§4.5). No
lifecycle enum.

| alt | pros | cons | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A: `unloaded?`** | one predicate; covers the postcondition and tests | says nothing mid-unload | **chosen** |
| B: `(state l)` enum | OSGi-comprehensible | freezes a keyword vocabulary; `:unloading` is transient and any test for it is flaky | rejected |
| C: nothing | smallest API | callers can't check | rejected |
| **D: `(status l)` map** | best debugging story; matches house style (`get-loaded-extensions`, `:initialized?`) | shape becomes API (mitigated: diagnostics-only) | **chosen, alongside A** |

### 12.4 Lazy vs eager `find` — **C: data hits + loader-owned opening**

*Decision*: hits are pure data (no streams, no closures, no compiled
artifacts); `find` locates, `load` reads, `(open-hit l hit)` opens resources,
and `load` accepts a hit from `find` to skip re-resolution (§4.4). Loader
*construction* is the one eager-validation point.

| alt | pros | cons | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| A: eager (read at find) | simple; read errors surface at find | every probe reads; `getResources` reads all hits for one result; repeated on every resource call (§0.4); jar churn | rejected |
| B: lazy opener closure in the hit | cheap probes | hits not printable/comparable/serializable; defeats AOT read-note bookkeeping | rejected |
| **C: data hit + `open-hit` + `load` takes hit** | cheap probes; hits printable/comparable; loader owns opening (policy, read notes); validation has a home | `load` must accept a hit (small API addition) | **chosen** |

Matches jolt internals (`find-ns-file` locates / `ldr-read-source` reads;
`resolve-resource` returns a URL that opens on demand), so the native backend
maps onto it without rework.

### 12.5 Still open

- Does the conformance suite ship with the lib at promotion (a `-test`
  artifact), or stay in kmet's `test/` as the reference implementation of
  the spec? (Phase 4 detail; the suite is the spec, so this is a packaging
  question, not a design one.)
- `remove!` (OSGi's terminal uninstall: delete owned files/storage) — v1
  leaves it out; revisit if a loader ever owns a cache directory.
